                 "NSYNC was my very first concert(that wasnt baby me being dragged along by my parents),
                 so I think it automatically has to be in the top! My mom brought my older sister and me, along
                 with my best friends mom bringing her and her older sister. The funny end to the story is that
                 my best friend's mom is now my stepmom, but that's a much longer story for a much darker day!"

                  "2009 Bamboozle was my first multiday festival when I was younger and ended up being a super
                  chaotic trip because it's when everyone was deathly afraid of swine flu. Look at us now.. 
                  It was the first time, outside of Warped Tour, that I was able to see so many bands at once
                  in one place and it's probably what originally got me so hooked on festivals to begin with."

                  "This will always be a band that's been near and dear to my heart since they were created.
                  I finally was able to start seeing them in highschool into college and never said no, anytime
                  the opportunity arose. I've cried at these shows more times than I can proudly admit and 
                  it's the one band I have purchased every final they have. There's been a decent amount of
                  issues with their members but wont change that their stage presense is unmatched."

                 "This is one of the first free Canalside concerts from the first summer I officially
                 lived in Buffalo yearround. It was a huge step for me and the first huge outing of my
                 household together. It alone has so many memories I'll never forget."

                  "Running house venues in Buffalo for years was an experience like any other and was
                  definiltey not for the faint of heart. I loved the memories and the friends it built
                  me but it also came with its hardships. But I'd never change them for the world.
                  When I explain running a punkhouse venue to people sometimes now a days they are 
                  pretty baffled by the whole idea, but it's definiltey not for everyone.

                  beyond this world. Willie, Crockett, Rateliff, what a line up. But really 
                  it's on the list because it's when I started dating my partner."
